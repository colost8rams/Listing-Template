# Listing-Template
My first attempt at an HTML template for ebay listings

This is my first attempt at authoring a web page in about 15 years! so I am basically a newbie all over again. When I was first learning, blinks and marquees were all the rage! :)

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

NOTES:
The CSS would normally be a separate file, but I have been told that Ebay prefers the CSS in your listing to be in the html document, not linked.

NEED HELP!:  The image gallery seems to be working OK, but I am pretty sure my code violates pretty much all convention.  Is there a better way to do this that does not require javascript?  (another ebay requirement).
